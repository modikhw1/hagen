    prompt: `Analyze the SOCIAL DYNAMICS in this video with extreme precision:

1. AUTHORITY & CREDIBILITY
   - How does the creator establish credibility? (expertise, confidence, social proof)
   - Eye contact patterns: Direct (commanding) vs averted (relatable) vs shifting (uncertain)
   - Body positioning: Open/confident vs closed/defensive vs casual/approachable
   - Vocal authority markers: Pace, certainty, hedging language
   - Timestamp each authority-establishing moment

2. AUDIENCE RELATIONSHIP
   - Parasocial techniques: Direct address ("you"), inclusive language ("we"), personal disclosure
   - Power dynamic: Talking AT viewers (broadcasting) vs WITH them (conversing) vs TO them (teaching)
   - Implied audience: Who does the creator think is watching?
   - Distance: Professional/distant vs friendly/peer vs intimate/confessional

3. SOCIAL PROOF & STATUS
   - Explicit claims of authority or popularity
   - Implicit status signals (environment, possessions, associations, knowledge display)
   - In-group/out-group language ("people who get it", "unlike most...")
   - Borrowed credibility (references to authorities, research, consensus)

4. TRUST ARCHITECTURE
   - Vulnerability moments: Real vs performed
   - Consistency between verbal content and non-verbal signals
   - What are they NOT saying? (Strategic omissions)
   - Promise-to-delivery ratio in previous statements within the video

    prompt: `Map the EMOTIONAL & TONAL JOURNEY of this video:

SEGMENT-BY-SEGMENT ANALYSIS (every 5 seconds):
For each segment provide:
- Timestamp range
- Dominant emotion being projected (specific: not "happy" but "triumphant", "playfully mischievous", "earnestly curious")
- Energy level (1-10)
- Intimacy level: Broadcast (1) → Group chat (5) → Personal conversation (10)
- Tonal intent: Educate / Entertain / Persuade / Connect / Provoke / Comfort

TONAL SHIFTS (critical moments):
- Where does energy change dramatically? Why?
- Where does the creator's persona shift?
- "Mask slip" moments - where authenticity breaks through performance
- Strategic tonal changes (softening before an ask, intensifying for emphasis)

TONAL FORMULA:
- Hook tone → Body tone → CTA tone
- Is there consistency or strategic variation?
- What emotion does the viewer leave with?

EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION FLAGS:
- Manufactured urgency
- Guilt or shame triggers
- Fear appeals
- False scarcity
- Identity threats ("you're not X if you don't...")

1. HOOK PSYCHOLOGY (first 3 seconds)
   - Primary cognitive trigger: Curiosity gap / Fear / Desire / Identity / Pattern interrupt / Controversy
   - The implicit promise: What does the viewer expect to get?
   - Specific technique used (name it if recognizable)
   - Effectiveness prediction: Will this stop a scroll?

2. RETENTION MECHANICS
   - Open loops: Unresolved questions or tensions (with timestamps)
   - Payoff timing: When are loops closed?
   - Information architecture: Drip (builds anticipation) vs Dump (overwhelms)
   - Re-hooks: Secondary hooks throughout the video

3. CREDIBILITY CONSTRUCTION
   - Evidence presentation: Stories / Data / Demonstrations / Testimonials
   - Objection handling: Does the creator address doubts?
   - Certainty calibration: Appropriate confidence for claims?

4. CALL-TO-ACTION ARCHITECTURE
   - Is there an ask? (Explicit or implicit)
   - How is it framed? (Benefit to viewer vs benefit to creator)
   - Reciprocity: Has the creator given value first?
   - Friction: How easy is the ask to complete?

5. PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES (flag if present)
   - Scarcity (real or manufactured)
   - Social proof (authentic or fabricated)
   - Authority appeal (earned or borrowed)
   - Commitment/consistency traps
   - Liking triggers (similarity, compliments, familiarity)

Rate overall persuasive effectiveness (1-10) and ethical score (1-10).

    name: 'authenticity_detection',
    description: 'Assess genuine vs performed elements',
    prompt: `Analyze AUTHENTICITY vs PERFORMANCE in this video:

AUTHENTIC SIGNALS (look for):
- Micro-expressions that contradict or complicate the narrative
- Unscripted moments: stumbles, genuine surprise, real laughter
- Eye movement: Recall patterns (looking up-left for right-handed) vs constructed (up-right)
- Natural speech: Filler words, self-corrections, incomplete thoughts
- Breathing patterns: Relaxed vs controlled vs anxious
- Genuine emotion: Does it reach the eyes?

PERFORMANCE SIGNALS (look for):
- Over-rehearsed delivery: Too smooth, unnatural pausing
- "YouTuber voice": Exaggerated enthusiasm, pitch variation, cadence
- Fake reactions: Exaggerated surprise, manufactured excitement
- Strategic vulnerability: Planned "authentic" moments that feel calculated
- Scripted spontaneity: "Random" elements that are clearly planned

SEGMENT-BY-SEGMENT AUTHENTICITY SCORE:
For each major segment (hook, each main point, CTA):
- Authenticity score (1-10)
- Key signals that informed the score
- What specifically feels genuine?
- What specifically feels performed?

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
- Where is the creator MOST genuine?
- Where is it MOST performed?
- Is the performance appropriate for the content type?
- Does inauthenticity serve or hurt the message?
