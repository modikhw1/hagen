═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DEEP HUMOR REASONING CHAIN (Complete BEFORE labeling humor type)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For EVERY video with humor, answer these questions IN ORDER before assigning labels:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 1: CHARACTER DYNAMICS
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Don't describe what characters DO. Describe their RELATIONSHIP and MOTIVATIONS.
│
│ Ask: "What dynamic exists between these characters?"
│ 
│ Common dynamics in service industry content:
│ • Worker who must maintain professionalism vs. customer who doesn't deserve it
│ • Workers who want less work vs. managers who want more output
│ • Someone who thinks they're clever vs. someone who sees through it
│ • Public performance of service vs. private reality (dead inside)
│ • The person doing the work vs. the person benefiting from it
│
│ OUTPUT: character_dynamic field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 2: UNDERLYING TENSION
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Every joke has tension. Find it. The humor lives in the GAP between opposites.
│
│ Ask: "What tension does this create?"
│
│ Common tensions:
│ • Professionalism vs. genuine emotion
│ • What you say vs. what you mean
│ • Customer expectations vs. reality
│ • Performance (fake smile) vs. authenticity (frustration)
│ • What SHOULD happen vs. what DOES happen
│
│ OUTPUT: underlying_tension field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 3: FORMAT PARTICIPATION
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ The STRUCTURE of the video can be part of the joke.
│
│ Ask: "Does the format/structure participate in the humor?"
│
│ Format elements that become jokes:
│ • Pattern established → then broken (person refuses to play the game)
│ • POV misdirection (you think you know whose perspective, then discover otherwise)
│ • Escalation structure (each beat raises stakes until break)
│ • Mid-word/mid-action cut (implies without stating)
│ • Interview format subverted (interviewee or interviewer breaks role)
│
│ OUTPUT: format_participation field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 4: EDITING AS COMEDY
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Editing choices are often part of the joke. Analyze them.
│
│ Ask: "Did an editing choice add to the humor?"
│
│ Editing techniques:
│ • Mid-word cut: Implies profanity/action without showing it (feels authentic)
│ • Hard cut to black: Maximum impact ending, no resolution
│ • Held beat: Forces viewer to sit in awkwardness
│ • Pattern-pattern-break: Same rhythm then different on the break
│ • Reveal cut: Cut shows something that recontextualizes previous content
│
│ OUTPUT: editing_contribution field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 5: AUDIENCE SURROGATE
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Often one character represents what the audience feels.
│
│ Ask: "Is there a character the audience identifies with?"
│
│ The Rebel Worker Archetype:
│ • A worker who breaks professional composure
│ • Often the one "actually doing the work" (chef, server, kitchen staff)
│ • Expresses what viewers wish they could say
│ • Breaking from expected behavior is cathartic
│
│ OUTPUT: audience_surrogate field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 6: SOCIAL DYNAMICS & CRUELTY
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Many jokes involve social power, embarrassment, or casual cruelty.
│
│ Ask: "Is someone being embarrassed, rejected, or put down? Is that the joke?"
│
│ Types of social dynamics in humor:
│ • Mean humor: Casual cruelty delivered deadpan (beauty discount = rejection)
│ • Embarrassment comedy: Someone misunderstands and looks foolish
│ • Status reversal: Low-status person gains power, high-status person humbled
│ • Escalation: Small disagreement builds to absurd proportions
│ • Misunderstanding comedy: Literal vs intended interpretation (shake = dance)
│
│ Key insight: If someone is embarrassed or rejected, NAME IT. 
│ "The joke is that she's told she's not attractive" is clearer than "subversion."
│
│ OUTPUT: social_dynamic field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 7: CONTENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Not all content works. Be honest about quality.
│
│ Ask: "Does this joke actually land? Is the premise strong or weak?"
│
│ Quality indicators:
│ • Strong premise: The core idea is inherently funny/interesting
│ • Weak premise: Relies entirely on delivery/energy to carry thin concept
│ • Recognizable but not funny: Relatable moment without actual humor payoff
│ • Broken logic: The joke doesn't quite make sense on examination
│ • Execution-dependent: Good idea that needs perfect timing to work
│
│ Be willing to say: "This is more relatable than funny" or 
│ "The premise is weak but the delivery saves it"
│
│ OUTPUT: quality_assessment field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 8: THE EXPLANATION TEST
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Before finalizing your humor analysis, check your explanation.
│
│ ❌ WRONG: "The humor comes from the contrast between the characters"
│    (This labels but doesn't explain)
│
│ ✅ RIGHT: "The humor comes from each answer revealing self-interest based on 
│    job role - those who profit want more, those who labor want less. The chef 
│    breaks the format entirely by refusing to give a number, expressing the 
│    frustration of being the one 'actually doing the work'."
│    (This explains the MECHANISM)
│
│ Rule: If your explanation could apply to multiple videos, it's too shallow.
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
