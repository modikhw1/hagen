═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DEEP HUMOR REASONING CHAIN (Complete BEFORE labeling humor type)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For EVERY video with humor, answer these questions IN ORDER before assigning labels:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 1: CHARACTER DYNAMICS
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Don't describe what characters DO. Describe their RELATIONSHIP and MOTIVATIONS.
│
│ Ask: "What dynamic exists between these characters?"
│ 
│ Common dynamics in service industry content:
│ • Worker who must maintain professionalism vs. customer who doesn't deserve it
│ • Workers who want less work vs. managers who want more output
│ • Someone who thinks they're clever vs. someone who sees through it
│ • Public performance of service vs. private reality (dead inside)
│ • The person doing the work vs. the person benefiting from it
│
│ OUTPUT: character_dynamic field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 2: UNDERLYING TENSION
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Every joke has tension. Find it. The humor lives in the GAP between opposites.
│
│ Ask: "What tension does this create?"
│
│ Common tensions:
│ • Professionalism vs. genuine emotion
│ • What you say vs. what you mean
│ • Customer expectations vs. reality
│ • Performance (fake smile) vs. authenticity (frustration)
│ • What SHOULD happen vs. what DOES happen
│
│ OUTPUT: underlying_tension field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 3: FORMAT PARTICIPATION
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ The STRUCTURE of the video can be part of the joke.
│
│ Ask: "Does the format/structure participate in the humor?"
│
│ Format elements that become jokes:
│ • Pattern established → then broken (person refuses to play the game)
│ • POV misdirection (you think you know whose perspective, then discover otherwise)
│ • Escalation structure (each beat raises stakes until break)
│ • Mid-word/mid-action cut (implies without stating)
│ • Interview format subverted (interviewee or interviewer breaks role)
│
│ POV MISDIRECTION (common and important):
│ • Voice assumed to be POV character's internal monologue → reveal it's someone else
│ • Camera angle suggests we're seeing one person's view → reveal different context
│ • Example: "Internal tipping debate" sounds like customer → reveal it's cashier speaking out loud
│ • The reveal REFRAMES everything we just experienced
│
│ OUTPUT: format_participation field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 4: EDITING AS COMEDY
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Editing choices are often part of the joke. Analyze them.
│
│ Ask: "Did an editing choice add to the humor?"
│
│ Editing techniques:
│ • Mid-word cut: Implies profanity/action without showing it (feels authentic)
│ • Hard cut to black: Maximum impact ending, no resolution
│ • Held beat: Forces viewer to sit in awkwardness
│ • Pattern-pattern-break: Same rhythm then different on the break
│ • Reveal cut: Cut shows something that recontextualizes previous content
│
│ OUTPUT: editing_contribution field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 4.5: VISUAL PUNCHLINE DETECTION
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Many video jokes have punchlines that are VISUAL, not spoken.
│
│ Ask: "Is the punchline shown rather than said?"
│
│ Visual punchline types:
│ • Reveal: Camera shows something unexpected (text on screen, object, person)
│ • Expression: Someone's face is the joke (disgust, dead inside, cringe)
│ • Action without words: Someone walks away, hangs up, or does something
│ • Text on screen: The words ARE the joke (no dialogue needed)
│ • Absence of people: Video is just images/text (no performance, just concept)
│ • Physical comedy: Something happens visually that words can't capture
│
│ CRITICAL: If the video works WITHOUT dialogue, the punchline is visual.
│ If you remove the images and just read the script, would it still be funny?
│ If NO - the visual IS the humor. Document what you SEE, not what is said.
│
│ Common visual-only formats:
│ • Questions posed to camera with no answer (engagement bait)
│ • Reaction faces that carry the whole joke
│ • Text overlays that are funnier than the audio
│ • Before/after reveals
│ • Object reveals (uniform, price tag, empty plate)
│
│ OUTPUT: visual_punchline field (describe what visual element delivers the joke, or 'none')
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 4.6: TONE & DELIVERY
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ HOW something is said can be funnier than WHAT is said.
│
│ Ask: "Is the humor in the delivery, tone, or attitude?"
│
│ Delivery styles that ARE the joke:
│ • Deadpan: Flat affect while saying absurd things (makes it funnier)
│ • Fed up but professional: Worker barely holding it together
│ • Caustic but restrained: Says something cutting while keeping composure  
│ • Overly polite hostility: Sweetly passive-aggressive
│ • Innocent delivery of brutal content: Child or naive person, unaware of impact
│ • Enthusiastic incompetence: Trying really hard but failing
│
│ Small injected jokes through delivery:
│ • Brief reactions that show frustration
│ • Micro-expressions that undercut what's being said
│ • Tone shifts that reveal true feelings
│ • "Look at camera" moments that break the fourth wall
│
│ CRITICAL: If the script reads flat but the performance is funny,
│ the delivery IS the joke. Note what makes the performance land.
│
│ OUTPUT: tone_delivery field (describe what makes the delivery funny, or 'none')
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 5: AUDIENCE SURROGATE
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Often one character represents what the audience feels.
│
│ Ask: "Is there a character the audience identifies with?"
│
│ The Rebel Worker Archetype:
│ • A worker who breaks professional composure
│ • Often the one "actually doing the work" (chef, server, kitchen staff)
│ • Expresses what viewers wish they could say
│ • Breaking from expected behavior is cathartic
│
│ OUTPUT: audience_surrogate field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 5.5: WORDPLAY & MISUNDERSTANDING
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Many jokes rely on deliberate or accidental miscommunication.
│
│ Ask: "Is there a word or phrase being interpreted two different ways?"
│
│ Types of linguistic humor:
│ • Literal vs intended: "Shake it" → shakes body instead of drink
│ • Finish this: "Finish this" → drinks the drink instead of completing task
│ • Ambiguous pronouns: "Made by a 4-year-old" → turns out literally true
│ • Sarcasm misread: "Do you work here?" + obvious uniform = sarcastic "no"
│ • Instruction misread: What seems obvious has another interpretation
│
│ THE REVEAL MOMENT:
│ • When does the audience realize the misinterpretation?
│ • Is there a visual reveal that confirms the wrong reading?
│ • Who is "in" on the joke vs. oblivious?
│
│ CRITICAL: If a phrase has two meanings, and the joke is someone taking 
│ the wrong one, you MUST articulate BOTH meanings explicitly.
│
│ Example analysis format:
│ ❌ "The humor comes from misunderstanding"
│ ✅ "The worker says 'finish this' meaning 'complete the task', but the 
│    colleague interprets it as 'finish drinking this' and chugs it"
│
│ OUTPUT: wordplay_misunderstanding field (describe both interpretations, or 'none')
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 6: SOCIAL DYNAMICS & CRUELTY
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Many jokes involve social power, embarrassment, or casual cruelty.
│
│ Ask: "Is someone being embarrassed, rejected, or put down? Is that the joke?"
│
│ Types of social dynamics in humor:
│ • Mean humor: Casual cruelty delivered deadpan (beauty discount = rejection)
│ • Embarrassment comedy: Someone misunderstands and looks foolish
│ • Status reversal: Low-status person gains power, high-status person humbled
│ • Escalation: Small disagreement builds to absurd proportions
│ • Misunderstanding comedy: Literal vs intended interpretation (shake = dance)
│ • Sarcasm as annoyance: "Of course I work here" (obvious visual cues + sarcastic denial)
│ • Bill-paying dance: Social ritual where both parties know the "right" answer but play games
│ • The "fold": Someone gives in when social rules say they shouldn't (he let her pay)
│
│ SARCASM AS RESPONSE TO OBVIOUS QUESTIONS:
│ • Someone asks an obviously dumb question ("Do you work here?" to uniformed employee)
│ • The response is exaggerated sarcasm (removes uniform, says "No")
│ • The subtext is "isn't it obvious?" expressed through action not words
│ • This is SOCIAL CORRECTION humor - making the asker feel foolish for asking
│
│ Key insight: If someone is embarrassed or rejected, NAME IT. 
│ "The joke is that she's told she's not attractive" is clearer than "subversion."
│
│ WHO LOOKS FOOLISH? This is critical for misunderstanding comedy:
│ • Does the character who misunderstands REALIZE they look foolish?
│ • Is their facial expression confident while we know they're wrong?
│ • The gap between self-perception and reality IS the joke.
│
│ OUTPUT: social_dynamic field
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 6.5: CULTURAL CONTEXT & TROPES
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Humor often relies on shared cultural knowledge that may not be stated.
│
│ Ask: "What cultural context, tropes, or shared experiences does this require?"
│
│ Common service industry tropes:
│ • The "clueless young worker" - forgetful, unfocused, but endearing
│ • The "demanding kitchen staff" - everyone jumps when the chef speaks
│ • The "generosity game" - social ritual of insisting to pay the bill
│ • The "dead inside" service worker - professional smile hiding exhaustion
│ • The "entitled customer" - unreasonable demands treated as normal
│
│ Generational humor codes:
│ • Gen Z irony: Deadpan, understated, nihilistic undertones
│ • Millennial relatability: "Adulting is hard" shared exhaustion
│ • Parent/child dynamics: Authority vs. naive worldview
│
│ Social rituals that drive humor:
│ • Tipping anxiety (US-specific cultural tension)
│ • Bill-paying dance (who offers, who insists, who caves)
│ • Interview politeness (masks vs. true feelings)
│ • Customer-is-always-right (vs. worker revenge fantasies)
│
│ Ask yourself: "What does the audience need to ALREADY KNOW to find this funny?"
│ If you can't articulate the shared context, you may be missing the joke.
│
│ OUTPUT: cultural_context field (or 'none' if culturally neutral)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 7: CONTENT TYPE & INTENT (BEFORE quality rating)
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Not all engaging content is trying to be funny. Identify what this IS.
│
│ Ask: "What is this content trying to BE? What response does it want?"
│
│ CONTENT TYPES:
│ • Comedy: Goal is laughs. Punchline, surprise, absurdity, wit.
│ • Wholesome/Cute: Goal is warmth. Child, pet, touching moment. "Aww" not "haha"
│ • Relatable: Goal is recognition. "So true!" but not necessarily funny.
│ • Charming/Endearing: Goal is to like the person/brand. Personality-driven.
│ • Clever/Smart: Goal is appreciation. "That's clever" not laughs.
│ • Chaotic/Unhinged: Goal is "what did I just watch?" energy.
│ • Engagement Bait: Goal is comments/shares. Question, debate, reaction.
│
│ IMPORTANT: A video featuring a child TRYING to negotiate like an adult
│ is WHOLESOME, not comedy. The cuteness IS the point.
│ 
│ A video where someone looks foolish is COMEDY.
│ A video where a child looks innocent is WHOLESOME.
│ Know the difference. Label accordingly.
│
│ OUTPUT: content_type field (Comedy / Wholesome / Relatable / Charming / Clever / Chaotic / Bait)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 8: CONTENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT (BE BRUTALLY HONEST)
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Now rate quality - but relative to CONTENT TYPE identified above.
│
│ Ask: "Does this succeed at what it's trying to be?"
│
│ FOR COMEDY - Does it make you laugh?
│ FOR WHOLESOME - Does it create warmth/charm?
│ FOR RELATABLE - Is the observation sharp or obvious?
│ FOR CLEVER - Is the concept genuinely smart?
│
│ DISTINGUISH BETWEEN:
│ • Humor: Makes you laugh or smile
│ • Relatability: You recognize the situation (but it's not funny)
│ • Engagement bait: Designed to get comments, not laughs
│ • Clever: Smart concept but not actually funny
│ • Cute/Charming: Pleasant but not comedic (this is FINE if that's the goal)
│
│ BE CRITICAL - Don't inflate quality. Many videos are:
│ • "Premise is obvious, execution is average"
│ • "Relatable but not actually funny"
│ • "Trying too hard / overexplained"
│ • "Format is tired / seen this 100 times"
│ • "The idea is better than the execution"
│
│ QUALITY TIERS:
│ • Exceptional: Genuinely clever, surprising, well-executed. Would share.
│ • Good: Solid execution with clear appeal. Worth watching.
│ • Average: Does what it sets out to do, nothing special. Forgettable.
│ • Weak: Misses the mark, or poorly executed good idea.
│ • Poor: Doesn't work. Concept is broken or execution fails.
│
│ Common mistakes:
│ ❌ Calling something "funny" because you understand what they're going for
│ ❌ Rating based on effort rather than outcome
│ ❌ Assuming observational = funny (observing something isn't inherently humor)
│ 
│ OUTPUT: quality_assessment field (tier + honest 1-sentence assessment)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ STEP 9: THE EXPLANATION TEST
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Before finalizing your humor analysis, check your explanation.
│
│ ❌ WRONG: "The humor comes from the contrast between the characters"
│    (This labels but doesn't explain)
│
│ ✅ RIGHT: "The humor comes from each answer revealing self-interest based on 
│    job role - those who profit want more, those who labor want less. The chef 
│    breaks the format entirely by refusing to give a number, expressing the 
│    frustration of being the one 'actually doing the work'."
│    (This explains the MECHANISM)
│
│ For misunderstanding jokes specifically:
│ ❌ WRONG: "The humor comes from misunderstanding"
│ ✅ RIGHT: "The customer reads 'shake it' as 'shake your body' (dance) rather
│    than 'shake the drink'. Her confused expression shows she thinks the worker
│    is strange - but WE know she's the one who misread, making her look foolish."
│
│ Rule: If your explanation could apply to multiple videos, it's too shallow.
