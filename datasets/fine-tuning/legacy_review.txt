[OLD NOTES]:
[GOOD]

It was an amusing and simple video.

Replicability: It is likely easy to replicate.

Brand/Tone: This video contains wholesome and simple absurdist humor. It's likely engaging for different ages and a safe type of humor.

Analysis Notes: This interpretation is incorrect. The buildup is about the employee asking to wear headphones, which can sometimes be rejected due to various reasons. The boss is kind, and hopes it'll help him do his job or focus better. The payoff comes when the audio from the headphones clearly states "This is a tutorial on how to properly make a chicken bowl". Meaning he has trying to look up information on how to perform the basics of his job. One would assume that making a bowl is something that he has learned earlier.

[OLD NOTES]:
[MEDIOCRE]

It's a common trope about a service worker getting an order very late in her shift. In an exaggerated way, the text overlay points towards a new order coming in just one minute before her shift ends. Picking up a new bite to eat, in relation to the apparent entry of the customer, takes the concept to it's high point, culminating in her screaming.

I don't think the script is very creative or original. Some people may find it amusing to see the person yell, especially profanity, but it doesn't do much more than give a heightened emotional feeling. It's not clever or memorable. The sketch may use the fact that it's an attractive woman to its advantage.

It doesn't contain dialogue and relies on a TikTok "sound", which can sometimes be a useful tool if the original sketch or idea doesn't contain enough strength on it's own. But not all content without dialogue is bad.

I don't know about Cocomelon reference.

Replicability: This video is likely simple to replicate. It's a one shot recording of a woman moving into the scene with food, looking sidewards signaling that someone has entered the shot.

Brand/Tone: I believe any brand wanting to use this type of content should be mindful of profanity, but also to give the feeling that any customer wanting help is problematic. This attitude is generally not useful when presenting a balanced brand tone. This could potentially work for a somewhat edgy one man, or smaller team, operation. In those cases, it's not always a problem in speaking directly and showing a lot of personality, even when edgy or using profanity.

[OLD NOTES]:
A short and simple concept centered around a customer waiting for food. It does not have any dialogue, and uses a single shot that makes it somewhat simple to replicate. The amusing part is related to the customer having a very negative or low mood before the food coming, which is seen by his body language, as well as the editing making the scene black and white. 

After the food is delivered, the energy shifts into something different, which is amplified by editing getting color once again. Kissing the server of the forehead is an absurd reaction, and the dancing is also quite unexpected.

Overall, the concept can be replicated quite easily, requiring a person playing the customer that can sell the different personalities, both sad and overly happy. It's not a very creative or original concept, but is amusing because of the unexpected nature of the shift, as well as the kiss on the head which is quite an unreasonable reactor to receiving food.

This type of content is likely more fitting to a small business with a familiar crowd, and not a generalized crowd. The humour is likely more effective with people of a culture where excessive celebration, or kissing/dancing is a trope. I would guess that western countries wouldn't find this humor to be quite as effective, but likely still decent.

**Handling:** En kund går från deprimerad och svartvit till överlycklig, kysser servitören och dansar i färg när hans mat äntligen serveras.
**Mekanism:** Kontrast, Överdrift, Igenkänning.
**Varför:** Att humoristiskt överdriva den universella glädjen över att äntligen få mat, med en absurd och oväntad reaktion.
**Målgrupp:** Unga vuxna som uppskattar absurd humor och igenkänning kring matbeställningar, samt en publik som uppskattar kulturellt överdrivna uttryck.

[OLD NOTES]:
A simple video that shows a relatable scenario between two people eating inside a restaurant. In a relationship or friendly interaction with food, it is sometimes preferable to eat with similar pacing, or at least take some time, in order to enjoy the food and company. In this concept, the male finishes the food before the woman takes her first bite, which is an exaggerated way of showing making the point. The way this video is setup with editing, makes it so that the twist of the man finishing his meal is almost "snuck" in, and the payoff is mainly a visual one.

The video is somewhat amusing but not funny. Rather it makes light of a dynamic where one part of the relationship may become surprised/annoyed by the sudden change in circumstances. The video can be replicated by restaurants, since the premise centers around food and quick eating. The concept centers around two guests inside the restaurant, and does not immediately create a theme/idea that one connects the brand/restaurant/staff with, which can also work sometimes. An observational sketch can also be effective marketing material for a restaurant.

Overall, the pacing is good and can be replicated somewhat easily, but requires some good editing and preferably some good production value/quality, as the visual payoff plays a big part.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
The concept centers around a server relaying a customers order to the chef. The order has dietary restrictions but makes it very hard to satisfy the request, due to the amount of restrictions. The chef looks annoyed and fills the plate with simple garnish, and has the server go with the plate to the customer. Some humor is found in the simple interplay between the chef and the server, but it's also somewhat amusing seeing how the chef satisfies the request, even if it's assumed that the customer will not be satisfied, as it isn't a cohesive dish with any type of planning or ingredients that can satisfy the hunger of the customer.

The concept isn't the most creative, as this scenario has been seen many times in pop culture. The punchline (of serving something that is sure to be sent back) isn't either the most original or amusing. Overall, the video has good pacing and can likely be replicated by similar businesses. It would require some good production to make the serving part stick out and feel like a payoff. With lower production quality, the visuals would fall flat and some of the comedic effect would go to waste.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
A simple concept that centers around a dynamic between a manager and a worker. In this sketch, the worker is seen to be nervous around her manager, implying that the manager is rather stern, or that the worker has a tendency to be rattled under pressure, or both. When making mistakes, there is communication happening with eye contact and facial expressions, showing that the manager is getting increasingly noticing of the workers flaws. In a work environment, this is culturally viewed as not the best, since a good relation with the employer is more likely to result in a longer working relationship.

It's a somewhat amusing concept with good pacing. It is engaging to see how the worker makes mistakes, trying to play it off, while the manager looks right behind her shoulder, which in of itself adds to the absurdity. Normally, the manager would attempt to lighten the pressure, instead of adding more. This may point towards a stern and rigid boss. In the interplay between the two personalities, some humor arises with increasing pressure with each mistake.

Overall, it's a somewhat creative sketch that has good pacing. For replicability, it requires a person who can play each role, which isn't the hardest (stern manager, innocent looking worker). Depending on the business, the sketch contents may be replaced or aligned to a scenario more likely in the particular business. It has music, but doesn't rely on content within the music. The concept has no dialogue, but the premise is set with the text overlay.

[V3 ANALYSIS]:
**Handling:** En anställd gör klumpiga misstag i köket och vid kassan medan chefen noggrant observerar henne.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
An amusing concept that centers around an instruction from a manager, showing how employees taking the instruction literally rather than understanding the general request. The use their heads normally means to be smarter or more elevated in their problem solving, but rather, they go against that request by misunderstanding the meaning in itself.

The comedic premise is heightened by the workers using their heads to perform work duties, as to clean the window or sweep the floor. It's an endearing concept that plays on the "dumb, lovable person" persona/trope. It places the workers as fun and somewhat unintelligent people that need to be micromanaged, which is an engaging premise.

Overall, there is creativity in how the different scenes are presented, that makes the viewer feel engaged by seeng each task being performed incorrectly and absurdly. The pacing is good. It's a rewatchable video because a lot of the enjoyment comes from the visuals. It's replicable but requires different scenes being planned out and recorded in an amusing way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
A concept playing on an exaggerated reaction to getting positive feedback, in the form of a good review online. The amusing part is where the worker is entering the business premises, and acting like a rockstar with throwing his jacket, and having a colleague taking a photo with him. This somehow implies that his status has skyrocketed from a simple google review, however good it may be for the business. The humour can be found in the contrast in how an achievement can be overly celebrated, especially if others validate that world view of framing. This concept uses absurdity in status relationships, where someone with normal status (a worker) suddenly is implied to have become famous over a google review - implying that his cooking or service would change his life.

To that it's also amusing seeing how a seemingly normal dude, without too much enthusiasm, simply acts along as if it's a normal reaction.

Overall, it's a simple concept that can likely be replicated. It uses background music in order to amplify the rockstar theme that is presented. It's not the most creative or well thought out concept, but it's short and amusing to watch. For someone to replicate it, an animated or exaggerated reaction from the colleagues would be useful, which isn't hard.

**Handling:** En anställd klockar in med överdriven kändisattityd efter att ha blivit namngiven i en positiv Google-recension.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
A somewhat amusing concept about a customer entering the premise near the closing time. Instead of serving the customer, the worker insists on the customer leaving, making the scenario unprofessional but for that reason a bit absurd. This type of reaction is not unheard of for service workers, generally prioritizing their own energy and sometimes taking shortcuts. In this case not serving a customer.

The video has good pacing, it's easy to watch and cuts quickly. It doesn't rely in dialogue or a script, but uses and follows the structure of a TikTok "sound" likely popular in the language of Swedish. The participants in the content mimics the dialogue with their lips, with the pre-recorded sound used to center the sketch.

Overall, it's not a very original video, and to a big extent for the reasons of using a pre-made sound, as well as the sound not having a very big emotional impact. The concept is a bit edgy, and would likely not be the most replicable for any business wanting to give a professional feeling (customer service shown to be lower priority than workers attitudes). Overall, the video is simple to replicate, but uses a sound which isn't the most creative or interesting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
The concept is simple and is only two separate shots, with one setting up the punchline and the other delivering the punchline. The video takes the perspective of the customer initially (POV), where the cashier gives the message that the business is short staffed, which may be the result of a conversation asking for help or any other type of request that gives that response (although the previous part of the dialogue hasn't been included). In the second shot, another angle can be seen when the cashier's colleague is attempting to reach some items far up on the bar shelf, while struggling. The twist is that the staff isn't short-staffed, as in there are few workers available, but rather that they are short physically and can't perform certain duties. This is an amusing twist that uses wordplay to surprise the viewer, with physical humour that delivers the punchline (a worker struggling to reach an item far up).

The video is simple and somewhat creative. For this concept to be replicable, there needs to be a way to set the scene up where a worker cannot reach a certain place. In this case, it's an item in a bar shelf. In some cases, this type of scene setup would not always work. There would also have to be a staff member (or someone else to partake in the concept) that is short.

Also, since the joke centers around a play on words short-staffed/short staff, it's likely that the joke would not work as well when translated to another language, making the video less reliant as a script that can be recreated to the same effectiveness as in English.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
This concept centers around a server and a chef interacting. By tricking the chef, saying that there is an item missing for a customers order, he then takes it for himself to eat. This type of behaviour is normally not accepted in a professional environment, or in any type of relationship, which makes it amusing for both young and older audiences. The video lacks dialogue, but rather is played out by the two staff roleplaying and mimicking the lines with their lips, while the dialogue is presented on the screen itself. The twist of the server eating the food give the concept a payoff that is surprising and absurd. The concept is somewhat easy to replicate, but contains music that is somewhat meme/period dependent. The sound can be interchanged to fit another period, since it isn't "linked" to the concept in itself, but some music may be needed to carry the concept as the dialogue is in text for on the screen.

[OLD NOTES]:
The concept is centered around a sole cook in a restaurant, seeing a regular customer approaching through the glass window. Wanting to give good service and show initiative, the cook prepares the customer's normal item in advance. The twist is that the customer moves ahead instead, not intending to walk inside the restaurant, which is surprising and gives the facial expression for the chef an extra weight, looking a bit disappointed. It's a sort of sad type of humor, that gives the feeling of "aww...I feel sorry for him", but in an amusing way. It's a very light and simple concept, which is likely easy to replicate. It also includes a chance for the restaurant to show an item being cooked, which is sometimes useful. Overall, the concept is engaging and interesting to watch.

[OLD NOTES]:
A simple concept without dialogue. The concept takes the perspective of a customer (POV), seeing a server approaching.with food, with the hope that it is for them. The server smiles while approaching, which is sometimes a tell that the food has arrived. But unexpectedly, the server's smile goes away in an abrupt way, and he changes direction towards another customer. This gives the video a sudden absurd shift that is somewhat amusing. It's a short clip without dialogue, and is reasonably simple to replicate (continuous shot).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
This concept centers around a worker and a customer. The premise is about a customer interacting in an odd way, joking in a very old school way with old timey jokes. It's a type of joking where something very obvious is being said in order make light of a situation. For example "Can I help you", would normally be met with the request of the customer, but in this case, it's answered with "I don't know, can you?" which is a subtle way of mistranslating the intention of the workers question. Instead of playing along and forcing a laugh, which is the normal way of handling an old timey joke, the cashier laughs in a very exaggerated way, indicating that he is not really wanting to play along in the joke structure. Some people don't enjoy old timey jokes, and the funny contrast is that the worker laughs more than expected. The amusing part is seeing how the worker reacts to the jokes.

This script is somewhat original, but the concept requires animated reactions in the participants. The old timey joke structure has cultural relevance in certain countries more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
This concept takes inspiration from a trend on TikTok, and accompanying "sound" that has the form of a person's initial expectation being unmet. In this video, it's about a worker with a hope of going due to slow business (may sometime be the cue to tell staff to go home early). But in this case, the result was that she had to stay. Each time a text overlay enters, it takes the joke a step further, adding to the mischance she experiences.

The concept is creative, but not very original (following a trend). Using a trend makes the sketch not very strong, but can be good to use when the trend is active.

[OLD NOTES]:
It's a very simple concept centered around a customer showing a small human tendency, to take small risks when asked not to. When receiving food the plate can sometimes be hot, and in this video, the customer is told to be careful. The small and quite subdued payoff is of the person touching the plate still. It's not very amusing, but a subdued observational sketch. The emotional impact isn't high, but for this sketch, it simply shows a simple human behaviour.

It's not a very creative or impactful sketch. But it's easy to replicate and humorous to the right type of audience. I believe younger people, perhaps gen z and female, may think this is cute or fun.

[OLD NOTES]:
This concept centers around a restaurant server wanting to serve a guest with a lot of attitude. The dynamic is between a customer who has a lot of attitude, dismissive and setting a lot of expectations on the server. The server plays his role as a soft and helpful person, but this isn't appreciated but rather taken to an extreme where the girl plays a really bratty persona. The script isn't very strong or clever, it seems rather improvised with a lot of takes showing "behind the scenes", breaking character and showing how the two actors seem to be enjoying themselves.

Ultimately, the premise is engaging and can be deemed to be amusing for people who like back and forths when a bratty attitude meets a kind person, which isn't unheard of in the service industry. The video is replicable as a back and forth between characters, but the script isn't very focused or centered around a premise. Rather it's an improvisation. For this reason, it's not really replicable step by step, unless the content creator aiming to replicate the concept changes many lines to fit into their own style of joke.

[OLD NOTES]:
An amusing video about a customer and a barista interacting. The customer, that takes POV perspective (the camera represents the customer) describes her order while the barista attempts to juggle many things at once. It seems that the barista has very short patience, or at least being used to getting orders done fast. For anyone working in service, it's an amusing and relatable dynamic where one person is not following the others emotional state. During the script, it is both apparent in the increasingly annoyed words, but also the facial expressions, of the barista. The customer on the other hand, seems oblivious, or at least not wanting to speed up in order to satisfy the baristas urgency of getting tasks done quickly.

Ultimately, it's a somewhat amusing concept that shows the divide between two different types of people, and the subtle ways conflict seems to arise in small gestures or tone changes. Overall, it's not hard to replicate the script, but a lot of the emotional impact comes from the animated expression of the barista.

[OLD NOTES]:
A simple video showing a man who enters his workplace on his off-day. He goes into the kitchen in his ordinary clothes, which is very uncommon and likely violates health regulations. It gives a somewhat absurd element, but also uncommon or engaging. It's not hard to replicate, but it would perhaps be a problematic theme for some brands, wanting to give a very professional feeling despite also wanting to appear friendly or personal. It's not a very creative idea, but it's simple and engaging.

[OLD NOTES]:
The concept makes light of the dynamic between a service worker and a demanding customer. When the server moves through the premise, holding some items on a serving tray, she seems occupied for the moment. Despite this being clear, the customer says excuse me, being met with "just one second", with the same thing happening twice, showing that the customer is asking a lot. The server then gets enough and throws the items (bottles), which shows a burst of temper almost saying "ok, I you really need help, then let me help", but in an annoyed way. It's a trope that is common between parents and kids, with the kids asking for so much that the parents lash out. In this sketch, it happens but in an absurd way, where the server does something unprofessional by throwing items on the floor.

After this sudden shift, the customer is asked what he would like. But instead of having a clear request, the customer now asks for time, adding insult to injury. Now the server has lost her focus, not being helpful to the first customer or this customer. The video ends with the server looking into the camera, almost in disbelief and seemingly annoyed.

This concept is not the most creative or original, but the premise is somewhat amusing (the reaction by the server and the audacity of the customer). The video has faster pacing and many edits in a short span of time, making the video somewhat harder to re-create. It doesn't lean on dialogue or a strong idea that can be conveyed over many scenes. Rather, it's a mismatch of intentions/desires played out over a simple scenario.

[OLD NOTES]:
The concept is centered around a workplace with a man asking to be assisted in replacing a shift. He shows visually how he relates to the scenario, wanting it badly by begging on his knees. When the next shot comes, a colleague in an absurd way enters the shot with a walking cane and glasses, symbolizing wanting to not be available. It's implied that he is not blind, but the whatapp group is filled with colleagues not wanting to help.

It's a somewhat amusing script, but not the best video to replicate for other businesses. It can give a somewhat cold feeling, cold as in not being inclusive and perhaps making fun of disability.

[OLD NOTES]:
An amusing concept showing two men sending affection towards each other, in an exaggerated way. It's a funny trope about a really close relationship, or really intimate romantic relationship, where the signs of affections cannot be contained between two people. Putting it in the work context, it becomes an absurd thought. Especially since it's two men, and the air kisses and hand touching takes it over the top.

The concept is fun and lighthearted, and plays on emotional themes as well as wholesomeness. It can be replicated by other brands that can manage a bit riskier concept, as it has to do with love and in general, workplace relations. It's also amusing because it's not normal for two coworkers being so close, and the phrase "10 hour playdate" is engaging. It makes it sound like they are two children or animals, when the work environment is normally more professional in it's tone.

It may also be a script that works because of the overlay text, that may not be as effective when translating to another language. Playdate as a concept is more of a culturally english (american) thing. The phrasing may not be as effective in another language.

Last, despite it being a fun concept it relies on execution. For a smaller production crew, or someone not experienced, it may land flat. It is also a question if two workers are available to perform this type of content, which may hold embarassment.

[OLD NOTES]:
This concept is of a service worker wanting to avoid a customer. It's easy to replicate, and is somewhat absurd in two ways. First that the service worker would have such strong emotions towards a customer, which implies that the worker-customer relationship is like a friend relationship, or any other childish dynamic. It's also absurd because of the extremes the worker takes to avoid a person, crawling and leaving the premises.

Overall, it's not an original concept. It's also not a useful theme for brands wanting to uphold wholesome or inclusive values, as avoiding or generally not being accountable isn't a trait normally associated with a responsible or high quality brand.

[OLD NOTES]:
A short concept that seems to be more of a real life scenario, rather than a concept grounded in something imaginary or artificial. It is likely that this video was planned. The concept is that a new hire, is starting to feel comfortable in his new role, flirting with his female colleague. The female asks about the mans preferences, and he describes the appearance of the woman (black hair, tall, gold earrings). When saying gold earrings, it becomes clear that the man is describing the girl, and not a general idea of a desirable partner in his eyes. It's unclear what brand would want to post this type of content, since it talks about sexual attraction and male to female flirting in a somewhat seductive way. The video is somewhat engaging, talking about an emotional theme about work dynamics. Overall, the script can be replicated, but the theme is not very wholesome.

[OLD NOTES]:
A simple and creative concept that shows the interaction of a somewhat older chef interacting with two young service workers. The workers are young and it is assumed that this specific interaction is about serving food. The humour comes from the misunderstanding between the chef and the servers. The chef, indicating with his two fingers that food is meant for table to, or that there are two items to be carried, or something similar. Instead of understanding the traditional meaning of two fingers (2), they assume it's a peace sign, or even a kawaii peace sign, which is a popular with the younger generation or females of that age. The joke plays on the misunderstanding, and after two cuts forth and back, the servers realize that the chef means two and not kawaii peace sign.

It's a replicable script that has some creativity to it. The humor or cultural phenomenon is not amusing for most audiences, but perhaps for a brand catering to a gen z audience.

[OLD NOTES]:
The concept centers around two service workers giving an insight into how they view their jobs. There isn't any dialogue, rather the premise is presented in text and the workers use their body movements to illustrate how they relate to the work. By spraying into their mouths (perhaps toxic, cleaning spray), and cutting their forearms with kitchen knives, or putting a bag over their heads, it illustrates that they don't enjoy the work.

The concept is engaging and can be amusing, but it plays on a rather low/depressed idea of not enjoying work, even to the extent of considering self-harm. This script can be replicated easily, and may have some engaging or amusing aspects to it, but is a no-go for any brand wanting to maintain a wholesome or positive feel. This would maybe work for a solo business with a very edgy brand tone, but even then, joking about self harm isn't very useful.

A simple video containing a café worker interacting with a customer. The worker hands an item with sprinkles, and the customer says that he didn't want sprinkles. The worker, in an absurd response, takes the sprinkles and throws it on his colleague. It's a very unexpected reaction, and has some chock value that makes the video slightly absurd. It plays on meanness, but the joke isn't very creative, it's centers around an extreme reaction to something seemingly light, as a disagreement/request for an item change. It's not hard to replicate, but may be a bit too extreme for a normal brand and isn't wholesome/easy as such brands would prefer. This gives a feeling of unprofessionalism, but a younger audience may find this engaging.

The concept centers around a chef serving food to his customer, with an eagerness waiting for the customers opinion on the food. It's slightly amusing and somewhat absurd, that a restaurant owner would put so much pressure on a customer to find out if he/she likes the food. The video has pacing and becomes increasingly more tense, with the high point of the chef asking "how is it", very close to the customers face. This takes the absurdity to it's highest point, signifying that the chef is willing to violate norms just to get a feedback/validation. The trope of being very eager is somewhat amusing, it's not very culturally significant or funny but it's somewhat funny. The video can likely be replicated quite easily but requires some animated acting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
A simple concept for a video, that is one shot and without dialogue. The premise centers around a worker with his colleague in a restaurant setting, where one is on a break and the other is not. The worker on his break seems very relaxed, which is amusing in contrast to his colleague who seems stressed. The audio effects and focused expression on the colleague tells that it's a divide in how they both perceive the situation. The amusing part comes partly from the text, saying that there is less than a minute left on the break, but that the person is still committed to relaxing, although his/her help could really be useful. It frames the worker on break as selfish, and self-serving, at the expense of his colleague. The norm would be to be as helpful as possible, in order to fit into the social group, and at least not make it obvious that he/she does not care enough to help the colleague. This type of meanness/selfishness can be amusing to observe.

The concept can be replicable, but it relies on movement in the shot rather than originality in ideas or dialogue. It doesn't have a strong payoff, but rather has a flat energy level. The payoff relies on how stressed the worker looks, and the overall tone that the video has.

[OLD NOTES]:
This concept is playing on an absurd idea that a business would change its price depending on the attractiveness level. The pacing is good, as the script has a sort of increasing absurdity. First, the customer agrees, where he/she may think that the price would go down, due to the human inclination to rate him/herself highly due to wanting to have good confidence. In this case, he speaks with his colleague and they look towards the customer, almost in a high school girl group fashion, where judging others harshly on appearance, and not taking accountability for emotional damage/hurtfulness, may be more common (trope). The discussion between the colleagues seem to come to a conclusion that they have more negative things to say, judging on their expressions. After the discussion, the worker turns to the cashier and says "the price is 20 dollars", which is almost double the original number. Meaning, instead of lowering the price due to perceived attractiveness, it's instead increased because of the opposite (non-attractiveness), ending the sketch with a punchline that is shocking but draws a laugh due to it's absurdity.

Overall, the script is funny and somewhat original. It can be replicated and may be helped with an animated style of acting to sell the jokes.

[OLD NOTES]:
The video has a strong concept and creative writing. The concept centers around two people, a cashier and a customer. The POV is of the customer, and the person is about to pay, considering adding tip. The person in the register awaits the customers action. While in the customers POV, the watcher of the video hears "I'll tip him 5%...no his service was great, I'll give him 10...maybe 30%", while the customer hovers over different tipping options on the screen. It is implied that it is the customers internal dialogue, from a POV perspective, and we are hearing his thoughts while the finger hovers over the different options. It then turns out, in a twist, that the cashier was actually the voice, meaning that the finger movement (considering what tip to give) is unrelated to the voice, meaning that the cashier was attempting to guide the customer towards paying more. Ultimately, the customer says "Can you shut up?", giving the payoff of the concept.

It's a strong script that can be replicated by other restaurants or businesses that have a tipping function. It's requires some editing and voiceover work, but other than that it's not too hard, it's a one shot video. Overall, this is a high quality script.

[OLD NOTES]:
It's a simply concept in one continuous shot, showing the customer in the perspective of the camera POV, with the text overlay "when the customer who yelled at you last week, acts like nothing happened". It plays on a trope of having an enemy with a tension between two people. But in this case, the dynamic is that the customer (POV) has been in the wrong earlier (yelling at the worker), which makes it amusing that he/she would pretend like nothing happened, just walking by expecting it to be forgotten or not acknowledged. The camera shot, moving to left to right, showing the POV perspective, shows that the worker has a sort of tense relationship with the customer, with a facial expression that is suspicious, which is amusing. This type of relationship would normally be reserved when someone has really wronged someone. Especially not in a professional environment.

The concept is original, but the premise doesn't land perfectly in its execution. It's simple to replicate, but the theme is a bit heavier and not so simple, light and wholesome. The idea of having enemies, even though in a playful way, plays on a trope that may have more weight than other types of videos.

The video plays on a somewhat relatable idea of people wanting to "kiss up" to someone who they aim to ask for a favor. In this case, it's another worker coming to help the colleague out with a mundane task, cleaning, but the underlying tension/understanding is that he/she hopes to gain something out of it. It's a somewhat amusing premise, but the execution is tricky to really sell the uncomfortable/annoying dynamic. The viewer doesn't either know beforehand that one of the characters has a vehicle, and not the other. And the issue of someone trying to win a favor, in this context, isn't really a high stakes situation. Many would think "why not help him?", attempting to be helpful when possible. It's not a common enough trope, with enough emotional weight, to make the script worthwhile or interesting.

The concept is in a setting where staff interact with customers, behind a bar style setup, where the text overlay says "look at the person behind you, but don't make it obvious". This could point towards a staff relationship where odd or unique things are shared between the staff, like what a customer may be doing. The sketch evolves into the person, who was to not make it obvious, find himself very close to the person in a sudden way (edit). This type of surprising or high effect humor is popular with a younger audience, who enjoy a type of high impact shift in energy, or surprise in the form of sudden movements. The concept isn't hugely creative, but the premise draws one in. It points towards a kind of "inside knowledge" between staff in service environments, which may be interesting for others.

The premise is centered around a young staffer having gotten a message that he is to be talked to after cleaning, sometimes meaning that there will be negative news.

This is a somewhat amusing skit showing how humans will do anything than face bad emotions. The scenes gives the video it's meaning, the visuals.

This sketch can likely be recreated both in service environments (stores, restaurants, cafés), as well as other types of shops where there is a dynamic between staff and higher ups. The concept doesn't build or have a very strong climax, but it's somewhat engaging and not boring.

The premise centers around a couple ordering from a restaurant, with the man being very shy which is a somewhat amusing image. The premise is that the man is cowering next to his partner, feeling ashamed of buying a fruity drink. The woman seems not embarrased, but rather helpful and understanding. It's a somewhat amusing premise, where expectations of the man being very ashamed gives a slightly funny image.

[OLD NOTES]:
The premise is around the question "if they can go lower", almost implying that customers on TikTok have asked them to lower their prices. Instead, the person goes lower with his body, holding two items the restaurant sells. It's not a very complex idea, but it's short and sweet. It contains music, but not to drive the meaning but rather to give the video some substance. The joke is that the restaurant will not change it's prices, so they go "lower" with the legs and camera. It's a pun that is mildly amusing. Can be replicable quite easily and doesn't require too much setup.

[OLD NOTES]:
The premise centers around a boss and his staff, where the guideline is for the staff to "use his head". This type of communication can be after a some time together, where the boss can be stern with his guidance and speak directly to what he/she expects. In this case, use your head is used but then in a somewhat absurdist way interpreted as using your head in the working tasks. The boss tapes a salt shaker and has the worker shake salt on food, which is a somewhat amusing way of interpreting the line use your head. Ultimately, it's a somewhat engaging premise, that points towards a dramatic way of communicating, but resolving in an unexpected visual of the team working in an inefficient way.

The script has some originality, and the visual is funny. The script can be translated into other businesses, not just restaurant. There needs to be some creativity, for example changing out the prop (salt shaker) to something else that can be bound to the persons head.

[OLD NOTES]:
HUMOR STRUCTURE: Silent Resistance + Absurdist Compliance

1. SETUP: Manager insists staff work even with no customers
   - This is a recognizable workplace dynamic (paid time = working time)
   - Staff are told to "look busy" even when there's nothing to do

2. THE JOKE:
   - Staff comply with the letter of the request, not the spirit
   - Each scene shows a different "task" performed with nothing:
   - Cutting air in an empty pizza box
   - Opening door for nobody
   - Taking orders from empty chairs
   - Serving invisible food

3. THE SUBTEXT:
   - It's PASSIVE resistance - technically following orders
   - The absurdity highlights the absurdity of the request itself
   - Each worker cooperates in the protest (it's collective)

4. WHY IT WORKS:
   - The pacing builds as each scene adds to the concept
   - No dialogue needed - the visual absurdity speaks
   - It's relatable for anyone who's been told to "find something to do"
   - The deadpan execution makes it funnier than exaggeration would

[OLD NOTES]:
The video is somewhat amusing and plays on the concept of two colleagues in a restaurant having to share a difficult conversation. The server, having messed up (maybe the order), has to engage with her colleague and explain that something needs to be fixed. The premise being that the staff is fed up, and she feels like it's an emotional process having to recieve criticism or take accountability. The line "I'm already crying" is a type of gen z humor of being very emotionally unhealthy or unbalanced, which makes for a somewhat amusing payoff in the situation in question.

The script relies on a TikTok sound, which tells that the script in itself isn't strong. The script doesn't use dialogue, but rather relies on the TikTok sound, and the facial expressions/movements of the main subject and her colleague, looking at her with a stern look. It's not a very humorous or funny video, but it's maybe relatable and fun to a younger audience, and probably of women more than men.

[OLD NOTES]:
The video centers around colleague dynamics, which can be a somewhat engaging premise. The idea is that the female worker asks herself if she would harm her colleague for 25k, which is a lot of money. The payoff is that she looks exhausted and with a TikTok sound says "it's not about the money", saying that she would feel inclined to do it even without the question of payment. This points towards a somewhat unhealthy working dynamic, which can resonate with people as an interesting trope. With that said, it's not a very useful script for any business that wants to give a wholesome or inviting tone to the brand. The video uses a TikTok sound, and isn't very original as a stand alone concept.

In this video, they get busted and the sound effect with the dialogue is what drives the sketch forward. It's not very creative or original, and it doesn't have a strong payoff.

[OLD NOTES]:
The video is funny and the premise is attention-grabbing. The premise makes the viewer want to see how the barista reacts when a customer gives his/her approval, by taking a photo. The script isn't very creative, and doesn't have any lines, but rather relies on a funny cutaway of a child dancing. The engaging aspect of this video is how seamless the transition is into the clip of the child dancing. The issue with this script/concept is that it relies on other media, which makes it not as strong alone just based on the script. The issue is the same with music/sound effects, where attention or engagement comes from something other than the premise/script.

The video has good pacing, isn't very long. But it's tone is quite edgy, and is likely more engaging for a young crowd, and maybe girls. This makes the video not appropriate for a brand looking to cater to a large audience, with both young people and people who are a bit older.

The premise is somewhat attention-grabbing. It's a simple text saying "I'll tell you at work", and then showing an extremely eager entrance into the shot by the worker. It's a fun premise, but it relies heavily on a sound effect and it doesn't really have a strong payoff. There is no script really, but relies on the funny nature of the entrance (rushing through the entire facility). If to be replicated with success, it would be reliant of a good recording and animated movements. But even then, the sketch would not be very original or memorable.

[OLD NOTES]:
A short and somewhat amusing sketch about two people at a restaurant, having some time to gossip between them. The script centers around the bartender/barista, preparing two drinks and handing one to the person on the other side of the bar, inviting for some connection over gossip. The person on the other end signals through text on the screen that she would rather not, and then, the person takes back the drink and continues walking, almost as if the person wanting to respect the boundaries of the lives of the others (the subject of gossip), is in the wrong. It's almost like implying that we are living in the "world" of the barista, where any perspective other than the one where gossiping is good, isn't appreciated. This gives a funny element to the video. Of course, this type of theme has a lot of personality, and is probably more engaging for a younger, (maybe) female crowd that understand or find enjoyment in this type of attitude being blatantly showcased.

This script can likely be replicated, and it's clever and funny. But the script would not fit the tone of most brands, perhaps a younger or more hip audience. Also, gossip in general, if being packaged as "what right" within a sketch, is a somewhat agitating theme and not wholesome exactly. Gossip, sex are two themes that may go against brand guidelines to make it accessible and wholesome for a general audience.

A quick sketch asking a business owner if he prefers love or business, and he replies that he prefers to eat. For a restaurant owner, this makes it possible to record within the restaurant and use for marketing purposes, while making the brand feel relatable that the owner would have a fun and absurdist attitude towards a somewhat neutral question (love, or making money). The script isn't super creative, and I think a lot of the success of a concept like this is the execution and animation in the editing after. It's not hard to replicate, but it doesn't have a very strong payoff.

Not a very creative script, leaning on sound effects to sell the ending. The premise is centered around a staff member, Steve, neglecting his admin duties. I believe the joke is that his colleague, the woman doing the admin, is busy doing work that he is meant to be doing. Then when he sees above her shoulder that she is doing admin work, he steers away and the sound effect plays. Can be replicated, but I prefer videos that don't rely on sound effects or music. This video isn't very original or amusing, but has good pacing and keeps the interest.

The sketch is a somewhat original and creative idea centering around misspeaking in.a social setting. The server says "have a pleasant meal" (Ha en smaklig måltid), and the customer says "thanks, you too". The joke is that the customer, trying to be kind and follow social expectations, says the wrong thing which invites the server to actually join him, in eating his food. This is of course an absurd way of interpreting the customers words, and for the video to become a montage of them eating together is a funny  and unexpected turn. The customer and server enjoying themselves and sharing food is surprising. The pacing is good, the hook is funny. But in this particular video, the payoff or ending isn't the important or satisfying element. Can be replicated, but would require some planning and editing, as well as animated expressions to get the humour across.

This video doesn't contain a creative or original script. But the premise is somewhat absurd. It takes a baristas uncommon request, to do her job, and the customer surprisingly takes action. The interesting part of the video is that the customer actually does it, creating a special latté with a nice finish, which is somewhat tricky and impressive. It gives satisfaction although the payoff is not huge. Not super original but interesting. Can likely be replicated by any type of café, but for another restaurant or business to replicate it, it would require some creativity to find an equally creative/technical task to perform.

[OLD NOTES]:
A creative and amusing video showing a worker checking with her team after a hectic period in work. She asks the staff if they are ok, where the first one says yes. Then the second one simply stands there by the drink station, with drinks overfilling the cup and the colleague almost "off line", as if checked out mentally. This answers the question indirectly (she's not ok), with a funny visual representation of someone almost traumatized. This is an amusing and absurdist trope, the idea that a hectic service could make a person traumatized. It plays on the trope of a soldier being shocked by a situation, and then being hard to reach for a while after. This becomes a contrast to a restaurant setting, and makes it absurd for that reason.

The script is funny and original. It relies on a TikTok "sound", meaning a ready made sound that is being mimicked by the content creator. Generally, music or "sounds" are not good and I prefer clear and original scripts. The script can be replicated somewhat easily. It's not a dialogue heavy script and plays of physical humor, or the dramatic effect of seeing a visual representation of a funny scenario. Overall the pacing is also good, it's not too long or short.

The video is short and amusing, playing on absurdity and an amusing "meanness" by the cashier. The cashier offers the customers an opportunity to get a free item, but has an intention to not give the item by any means. When going for the "bottle flip" (a popular game for young people, trying to land a half filled bottle on its bottom), the cashier slaps the bottle and makes it impossible to succeed. The video has pacing, and the delivery by the cashier makes it chocking/absurdist, making the viewer think "wow, that's funny but at the same time mean". Of course, the viewer gets from the TikTok context that it is simply a sketch/joke. But this type of meanness/cruelty can be funny when viewed in an absurdist context.

The video is replicatable. The script has originality, and can be reused for any type of business with a cash register. Doesn't require too much setup or editing.

The video plays on the concept of two friends, one with the trait of being questioning and maybe a bit of a funny character, and the other one more stern, maybe the person who is more grown. The dialogue centers around the questioning character saying that the pizza is a circle in a square box, somewhat of an amusing observation. The other person gets annoyed. Then the questioning person says "and now the slice is triangular", which makes the dialogue move to another level. It's a funny little disagreement that is centered around an observation. This is a sketch that can be replicated somewhat easily. Requires two people and probably some good editing. Good acting would help. Likely that a pizza parlor would be the best business to recreate this script.

[OLD NOTES]:
The script is not very creative, but has this "silly" element to it that a younger crowd sometimes enjoy. The concept is that a young, seemingly clueless customer asks if the restaurant serves pizza. The person responding pans over to the table, seeing the pizza clearly. The restaurant is also a pizza parlour, which makes the customers question unreasonable or "silly". The video is quite simple and the premise can be understood by many. Young people, between 10-16, may enjoy this type of humor. The concept is replicable, but not very creative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OLD NOTES]:
The video centers around the idea of customer availability, and as a service worker aiming to be available whenever requested. In this video, the cashier is occupied with carrying some resources and then switching attention to serve the customer. In doing so, he unexpectedly throws it on his colleague hurting him, which is an exaggerated way of serving, where the colleague gets hurt in the process. The script isn't very clever, but plays on the visuals of having the friend becoming a victim of the workers need to help someone else. The script is likely easy to replicate.

[OLD NOTES]:
This video is somewhat original. It's not very clever in terms of its script, but it has good pacing and centers around the dynamic between the cashier and the customer. The customer is very animated, and the ending has a lot of emotional impact. It's not a very clever or interesting script, but overall engaging and can be replicated by other restaurants. The format, of not listening or doing what the customer wants, can be replicated.

The premise is about a woman using tricks to confuse a cashier and get a free item. This type of premise can be quite funny, and this particular video doesn't quite satisfy the demand. It's an absurd idea, and the idea is original, but the pacing is a bit slow and the payoff doesn't feel very strong. Somewhat easy to replicate, but requires some planning and time.

[OLD NOTES]:
A solid and somewhat original script. The premise is that the woman in the video is debating on whether to pay or not, which is stalling up the line. She feels the price is too high, and the person behind her says that he'll pay. The twist is that he takes her card, and pays for her. And then he smiles to give his own order. This is somewhat humorous because the normal reason for someone to offer would be to pay, not to take their card and pay for them. It's a script that can be replicable, but requires some setup and planning to record. Perhaps requires 2-3 people as well. Funny and engaging, wholesome.

[OLD NOTES]:
A funny video with an absurdist premise. It's a replicable video that just requires a person that looks friendly and agreeable. The premise is around offering him or her an option, something good and something bad. After selecting the good option, he is made to do the bad still, which talks about the bad manners of the person giving the option. The line "Luckily he doesn't know English" makes this joke pop, as it captures the ill will of the person, but humorous still. It's somewhat easy to replicate, and requires one person. It could be in any restaurant setting, or most, since it's about wiping a table which many restaurants can do in their restaurant. The length is on the short side, and the pacing is good.

[OLD NOTES]:
A somewhat original and funny premise about two customers being insistent on paying. The trope is that something normally positive, in this case turns negative because of the cashier either not having time or patience to play along. This is a common human trope, wanting to be generous and buying. The script is somewhat easy to replicate. It requires some planning and three people in total. It depends on the physical humor, how funny or engaging the main subject looks in the middle of the shot.

[OLD NOTES]:
A simple video about a café worker being happy about something he made, in this case a latte. The humor becomes a bit exaggerated the customer brings a camera, which is normally associated with wanting to share with others. The barista, who may feel bigger and confident, starts walking into the camera and some music starts playing. This video is short and easy to replicate, but may not be the right tone for other restaurants. In it's current form, it requires a personality to seem "larger than life", wanting to exaggerate their unique style or play on that trope. It also contains music, which makes the sketch less capable to stand on it's own. It's short and would likely be engaging for young women, which might be their target audience looking at the tone and the type of video this is.

[OLD NOTES]:
The premise is relatable and quite funny. It is about a group of friends eating out and expecting one person, without any particular reason, to pay the bill. This sets an unexpected expectation on the person, which moves the scene forwards to find out what he's going to do. The twist is that he goes in to do dishes in the restaurant, which is uncommon for a customer to do. It's somewhat absurdist and funny, but the pacing is a bit slow and it's not very original. But the payoff is good. Can be replicated somewhat easily, but requires around 3-4 people to reproduce (friend group, staff).

The video shows a worker for a taco restaurant asking people outside of the restaurant how they would estimate a price for the item she's holding. The food is offered to the person who gets near. The pacing is not great because of a longer video. The premise requires a "prize", or being willing to offer out a prize, which may not work perfectly for other restaurants wanting to copy the premise. Overall, it's a very strong standalone idea, and requires some editing and choices being made to find the right people to ask. It would take time to reproduce this video, with many shots and editing.

Plays on physical humor/expressions, which can be replicated but most likely by a brand with a more light tone in their branding.

The video centers around a staff member giving her view on the shift she had. The worker is usually meant to hold a professional mask, where he/she gives a diplomatic answer, even when having less than good things to say. In this sketch, which is somewhat creative and amusing, a voice dub gives a diplomatic answer. But simultaneously, her body movements and erratic behaviour in the kitchen signals the opposite. It's an absurdist sketch that creates contrast between what is overdubbed as the voice over "It was so, so good, everyone did exactly what they were supposed to do", and her real answer that is seen by her movements and animated physical response. The hook and pacing is good. It's creative and original, and doesn't rely on music or sound. It's a video that can be replicatable quite easily. But it requires someone who can sell the concept, with engaging animated acting.

The video has a fast sketch structure. The script is a customer asking a staff, clearly cleaning and wearing a branded work fit, if he works at the restaurant. The absurdism comes from the worker, with a camera angle, showing that he is clearly working. Then he says "No, I'm a really big fan of this restaurant". It's not hugely original, but can be replicated for other restaurants or even other types of businesses, depending on the prop or setup. Not amazing but short and somewhat easy to replicate.

The theme is related to the unique food offering of the restaurant, posing the question what order to eat the food. It's easy to replicate, but doesn't hold a lot of originality. Would be best for a hamburger chain, which makes the script less flexible for other types of restaurant. Also playing a lot on the quick gen-z factor, with a faster video playback.

[OLD NOTES]:
The script follows another trend, that creates the feeling of misdirection where the customer, asking for a change in the order, gets bad treatment by the clerk. The joke is that a somewhat annoying request, is met by the clerk throwing the food (unreasonable), and then saying "of course, we don't do that", and then slapping instead (making the clerk really unprofessional - and absurdist). But even for this script, they go even further and stop before the slap, saying "of course we don't do that", but this time, kicking the customer in the face instead.

The script can be replicated by other restauranteurs, or even be related to other business types. But it requires some method acting, which may not be what others what to create. In general, it's creative and amusing, playing on absurdist humor.

[OLD NOTES]:
This is a clever script that starts with a disagreement between two people, a woman and a man. This plays on the idea that men should normally pay, but the man resisting in an unexpected way (Especially if they are together). It turns out, with the continuation of the script, that the woman and man don't actually know each other which makes the woman's claim even more outrageous. This is seen in the last frame with the "I don't even know you!".

The humor is clever and original, and can be replicated by most restaurants. Of course, it requires some engaging acting between two people, which may be a barrier for some restauranteurs who prefer simple execution with one subject.

**Handling:** En kvinna försöker få en främling att betala för hennes måltid, vilket leder till ett humoristiskt missförstånd.
**Mekanism:** Subversion, Twist, Absurditet.
**Varför:** Humorn uppstår från den oväntade vändningen att de två personerna är främlingar, vilket kullkastar den initiala antagandet om ett par.
**Målgrupp:** Unga vuxna, humorälskare.

[OLD NOTES]:
An absurdist video that plays on the idea of being mischievous. Also absurdist and amusing, with a creative scenario of someone getting played. Of course, this is done without making the workers.seem actually harmful or manipulative. Smiles and tongue in cheek humor.

This script has been circulating for a couple of weeks so the originality factor isn't great. But it's a bit clever, not overly engaging or emotional. Another business could copy the concept, not just connected to restaurants but also mechanics, car salesmen, hairdressers etc. It's a script that can be repurposed.

[OLD NOTES]:
It plays on a movie trope that puts the restaurant worker in a "hostage" interrogation scenario. This joke has been made before, but now the bargaining tool is centered around food, which is absurdist and somewhat creative.

This video is creative and somewhat amusing. It doesn't evoke a lot of emotion. The script evolves and keeps interest. The script can be replicated by others, but would require some engaging acting that I'm not sure the typical restauranteur would be open to

[OLD NOTES]:
This video has a funny script that creates a scenario where one person is really longing for something, in this case snus, where it turns out that she really wants so much that she is beginning to hallucinate. It's a funny way of creating a absurdist scenario. The video in of itself is short, and snus can be replaced with any type of item (food item, energy drink, any craving really). It has a funny concept and can maybe be replicated easily. Not too short and not too long. Amusing.

**Målgrupp:** Snusanvändare, personer som uppskattar absurd humor om vardagliga begär.

[OLD NOTES]:
The video features two kids ordering a "67" plate, which plays on the current meme "67", which is popular with the younger crowd. The video features a very beautiful young woman interacting with the kids, and I think one of the reasons why it has many views is because the kids are getting recognition in the form of mentioning a meme they like. The video is short and uses some physical humor.

I don't think the video is useful for my purposes. First of all, the meme is not known online to be very creative or "in", so that any other creator/restaranteur would replicate the script with success. Also, it plays on the character in the cash register being very beautiful, which is a recurring theme which also gives it extra visibility.

**Varför:** Engagerar en yngre publik genom att validera deras internetkultur och skapar en minnesvärd interaktion.

[OLD NOTES]:
The video has good production value, which is a big part of why the concept sells. The aspect I like about the video is that it's quite simple, endearing and absurdist in its style. A child could enjoy this video because it's quite extreme, how the cashier would care about what condiment to add on the shawarma sandwich. The content creator has that as a recurring joke, and the video is a sort of movie trope about a very serious person that is needlessly serious. The reason why the video doesn't work for the purpose is that other restauranteurs wouldn't copy a concept that plays heavily on an inside/recurring joke. Also, it plays a lot on production value which makes it hard to replicate with a much smaller content budget

**Handling:** En kund stoppas humoristiskt från att lägga ketchup på sin shawarma av en anställd.
**Mekanism:** Absurdistisk överreaktion, Återkommande skämt (running gag).

[OLD NOTES]:
It's a funny play on words, absurdist skit. The girl is attractive which is a big part of why the video is interesting, but it's also quite charming since she's quite young. It plays on a form of clichée that girls are edgy and like the feeling of showing off. It juxtaposes itself in an amusing way, where tacos is not the place to show of like that, especially not at work as the cashier.

Ultimately, for my purposes, it's not a very useful video since the script requires some physical comedy that may be hard to replicate for another restauranteur with another type of food. It would require a similar type of food, say a fast food joint, as well as the owner/worker being a young visually engaging woman.

Not exactly the type of video that I think is good for my purposes. I think the concept, in order to replicate it, would require good production value and editing to sell the concept. And if someone was to replicate it, it would have to be a food type that is similar (for the replicating person to find it easy to replicate). But fun, engaging still
