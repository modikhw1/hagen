If they don't produce it themselves, the equation changes. But if they do it themselves, then it will be useful to get a sense of how adaptable and willing to face editing/complex camera work is. Some concepts have higher or lower \"replicability\", which would usually include (are there many shots or complex editing work included, does the script need more that 2+ participants? the less the better, is there enough room or willingness to shoot within the premise, especially if it's complex or requires more time? how willing is the person to make the shooting work, overcome low replicability)\n\nThe second thing would be brand tone, and what is steered away from in terms of message or other. This is alluded to in many instances, but there isn't too much questioning (what is the target audience, are there any themes that are no go? adult or suggestive content? Edgy ok? And in that case, where does that line go). One would assume that the lines are drawn similarily for many, but questioning can be developed for this.",

I would like to to find a way of figuring out more specifically the type of content that the person produces, so that there are no \"bridges\" in understanding or missed opportunities in understanding. For example, in this case I just explained it as \"content geared towards young people, with POV and a prompt, workplace comedy\". But what is workplace comedy for the person? That can be very broad. When trying to get into details, it can make the conversation feel not flowing. But with the right implementation, perhaps something like \"Could you describe in detail how an archetypical video would look, if my description is something you agree upon?\". The phrasing of this sentence is strange, but it makes the point",

The clip is usually 5-15 second long, with a text overlay establishing the premise, and me playing out a funny and sometimes self-depricating sketch or concept. Examples could be me gossiping with my colleagues, taking on a customer in an unexpected way, insinuating that I'm tired of work etc. Stuff that is relatable for young people, but maybe girls more, and is still in \"fantasy land\", clearly a humorous page. I get a lot of views and likes, and try to keep my page very well maintained (high quality recording, editing, acting)",

You lean toward controlled, strategic content over personality-driven approaches, but you're seeing that TikTok rewards your sketch work more than your polished food cinematography.\n\nYou should probably lean harder into those engaging premises for TikTok while keeping the beautiful production for Instagram. The challenge is finding sketch concepts that feel premium enough for your brand positioning.\n\nSound accurate?",

That TikTok response shows you're confident and spontaneous.\n\nHere's what I'm most curious about: When you're creating content or talking to customers, what do you absolutely want to avoid? Like, what would feel totally wrong for Kebab Dudes - too corporate, too silly, too trendy, too traditional? \n\nAnd on the flip side, when you nail a piece of content and think \"yes, that's so us\" - what made it feel right?",

The \"voice\" means different things to different people. But although an abstraction, it is a description that fits. It's about what feeling the person gets by viewing their produced content (images, text, copy, type of videos, graphic design, themes they usually bring up). All of this creates a certain aura or \"energy field\", that isn't pointed towards but rather felt.\n\nSo asking directly isn't helpful.\n\n\"When it comes to content on a local level - what do you want?

Why in this combination? Why this selection\", but it's a good thing because then one can talk more specifically about genres of personalities (e.g. what is the genre we like? What is the genre we naturally gravitate towards, what do we see similar businesess do? What are our insights as to why we have taken these steps\".\n\n",

The content creator doubles as a bartender, giving them genuine insider access to customer interactions and the restaurant's daily rhythm. They're focused on TikTok as their primary platform, with a clear vision of creating 'fun, inviting content' that positions them as a 'modern and wonderful place to visit with friends.' What's particularly interesting is their sophisticated understanding that a business's age doesn't define its visual identity - they're deliberately crafting a contemporary brand experience that feels current and connected to what's happening in the world, while operating from a space with three decades of community roots.",

And TikTok is perfect for that fun, inviting energy you're talking about.\n\nI love that you want people to feel like it's a place to visit with friends - that's such a clear vision. When you picture your ideal TikTok showing off your restaurant, what do you see? Is it the team having fun behind the scenes, the food and drinks in action, customers enjoying themselves, or maybe that beautiful outdoor setting that makes your place special?\n\nAnd I'm curious - what does \"modern\" mean to you in the context of a 30-year-old restaurant? How do you balance honoring that legacy while showing you're fresh and current?",

Are we talking about the way you style your food photos, the colors and fonts you use, the music in your videos, the way your team presents themselves on camera?\n\nAnd I'm curious - what current trends or events do you find yourself wanting to tap into?
