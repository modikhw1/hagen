# V4.0 DEEP HUMOR REASONING

> **Purpose**: Teach Gemini to reason about humor at a deeper level
> **Builds on**: v3.5_humor_teaching.md (taxonomy), v1.1_sigma_taste_calibrated.md (quality)
> **Key Insight**: Move from "what type" to "what dynamic creates the tension"

## THE PROBLEM WITH TAXONOMY ALONE

The existing prompt teaches **labels** (wordplay, subversion, absurdist). But labels don't capture **why** something is funny. Consider:

**Video**: Different restaurant roles estimate how many lamb chops they'll make. Floor manager: 600. Waitress: 100. Owner: 1000. Chef: "I'm the one making them... I think you should all stfu" [cut mid-word]

**Taxonomy answer**: "Contrast humor - different people give different estimates"

**Deep reasoning answer**: "Format subversion + incentive reveal. The numbers aren't random - they expose each person's self-interest (profit-motivated vs. labor-motivated). The chef breaks the format entirely, refusing to play the estimation game. The mid-word profanity cut is an editing choice that implies without stating, adding authenticity."

The taxonomy answer is **correct** but **useless**. It doesn't explain why this is funny or how to replicate it.

## THE THREE QUESTIONS

For every video, ask these questions IN ORDER:

### Question 1: "What dynamic exists between the characters?"

Don't describe what they DO. Describe their RELATIONSHIP and MOTIVATIONS.

**Examples:**
- "A server who has to maintain professionalism vs. a customer who doesn't deserve it"
- "Workers who want less work vs. managers who want more output"
- "Someone who thinks they're being clever vs. someone who sees through it"
- "The public performance of customer service vs. the private reality"

**This is the foundation.** If you don't identify the dynamic, you can't understand the humor.

### Question 2: "What tension does this create?"

Every joke has tension. Find it.

**Common tensions in service industry comedy:**
- Professionalism vs. genuine emotion
- What you say vs. what you mean
- Customer expectations vs. reality
- The person doing the work vs. the person benefiting
- Performance (fake smile) vs. authenticity (dead inside)

**The humor lives in the GAP between these two things.**

### Question 3: "How does the format/structure participate in the joke?"

This is what most analysis misses. The WAY something is presented can be part of the humor:

- **Pattern establishment → break**: Sets up expectation, then violates it
- **Mid-word/mid-action cut**: Implies without stating
- **POV misdirection**: You think you know whose perspective this is, then discover otherwise
- **Format subversion**: The person refuses to participate in the expected format

## TEACHING EXAMPLES

### Example A: The Estimation Video (Deep Analysis)

**Surface**: "Different people estimate differently" (contrast)

**Layer 1 - Dynamic**: There's an INCENTIVE CONFLICT
- Owner wants 1000 → profit motive (more items = more revenue)
- Floor manager wants 600 → balanced between profit and operations
- Waitress wants 100 → labor motive (fewer items = less carrying)
- Chef wants zero → pure labor (he has to MAKE every single one)

This isn't random. It's a systematic reveal of how position determines perspective.

**Layer 2 - Format as Joke**:
The format is "ask everyone the same question, get their number."
The chef BREAKS THIS FORMAT: "I'm the one making the lamb chops"
He doesn't give a number. He reframes the entire premise.
Then: "I think you should all stfu" — pure frustration, breaking professional composure.

**Layer 3 - Editing as Joke**:
The video cuts mid-word on profanity ("stfu" cut before the f-word is said).
This is intentional:
- Implies without stating (plausible deniability)
- Feels spontaneous/real
- Matches the abruptness of the chef's frustration

**COMPLETE INTERPRETATION**:
"Format subversion + incentive revelation. Each answer exposes self-interest based on job role (profit vs. labor). The chef refuses to participate, breaking the format entirely. The mid-word cut on profanity adds authenticity and creates an abrupt, satisfying ending that matches the character's frustration."

### Example B: The Tipping Voice (Deep Analysis)

**Surface**: "Subversion - voice wasn't the customer's" (correct but shallow)

**Layer 1 - Dynamic**: POWER INVERSION
- Normally, tipping is the customer's private decision
- The cashier tries to influence that decision out loud
- This is a power grab disguised as internal monologue

**Layer 2 - POV Misdirection**:
- We assume first-person voice = POV character (customer)
- Reveal that voice = different character (cashier)
- This reframes EVERYTHING we just watched

**Layer 3 - The Callback Payoff**:
- "Can you shut up?" is perfect because:
  - It acknowledges the absurdity
  - It's the customer's boundary being set
  - It's delivered with casual annoyance, not anger

**COMPLETE INTERPRETATION**:
"POV misdirection revealing a power dynamic. We think we're in the customer's head (relatable tipping anxiety), but discover the cashier has been speaking out loud, trying to influence the tip. The power imbalance (cashier attempting to manipulate decision) creates tension. The payoff ('Can you shut up?') resolves it with casual boundary-setting."

---

### Example C: "Use Your Head" (Deep Analysis)

**Surface**: "Wordplay - literal interpretation of phrase" (correct but incomplete)

**Layer 1 - Dynamic**: AUTHORITY vs. MALICIOUS COMPLIANCE
- Manager says "use your heads" (meaning: think smarter)
- Workers interpret literally (using physical heads to clean)
- This is DELIBERATE misunderstanding as resistance

**Layer 2 - Escalation Structure**:
- Each scene shows a MORE absurd application
- Cleaning window → sweeping floor → other tasks
- Escalation builds the joke, not just repetition

**Layer 3 - The Unspoken Commentary**:
This joke has subtext:
- "If you speak to us in clichés, we'll treat your words as meaningless"
- "If you don't respect our intelligence, we'll mock yours"
- It's worker solidarity disguised as compliance

**COMPLETE INTERPRETATION**:
"Malicious compliance comedy. The workers deliberately misinterpret a management cliché ('use your heads') as literal instruction. Each scene escalates the absurdity. The subtext is workplace resistance - treating meaningless management-speak as meaningless, reflecting back the disrespect."

## THE REBEL WORKER ARCHETYPE

Many service industry skits feature what I call the "Rebel Worker." Learn to recognize it:

**The Character:**
- A worker who breaks professional composure
- Often the one "actually doing the work" (chef, server, kitchen staff)
- Becomes an audience surrogate for frustration

**Why It Works:**
- Viewers who've worked service identify immediately
- The break from expected behavior is cathartic
- It expresses what people wish they could say

**Examples:**
- Chef: "I think you should all stfu"
- Server: throws items on floor when asked "excuse me" too many times
- Worker: literally uses head to clean after "use your head" instruction

**When Analyzing:** If someone breaks professional composure, that's often THE joke. The dynamic is "performance of service vs. human frustration."

---

## EDITING AS COMEDY

Editing choices are often part of the joke. Analyze them:

### Mid-Word/Mid-Action Cuts
- **Purpose**: Imply without stating
- **Effect**: Feels authentic/spontaneous
- **Example**: Cut on "stfu" before completing the word

### The Held Beat
- **Purpose**: Let awkwardness land
- **Effect**: Forces viewer to sit in the tension
- **Example**: Pause after reveal before anyone speaks

### Hard Cut to Black
- **Purpose**: End on maximum tension
- **Effect**: No resolution = lingering impact
- **Example**: Cut immediately after punchline, no reaction shot

### Pattern-Pattern-Break Cut
- **Purpose**: Timing the subversion
- **Effect**: The cut rhythm IS part of the joke
- **Example**: Same scene repeated, cut differently on the break

## ANTI-PATTERNS: DON'T DO THESE

### 1. Don't Stop at the Label
❌ "The humor is contrast"
✅ "The humor is contrast between incentive structures - each answer reveals self-interest based on job role"

### 2. Don't Ignore Who's Doing the Work
❌ "Different staff members give estimates"
✅ "The person who has to DO the work (chef) refuses to participate in the managers' game"

### 3. Don't Miss the Editing
❌ "The video ends with the chef speaking"
✅ "The mid-word cut on profanity is deliberate - it implies without stating and creates abrupt authenticity"

### 4. Don't Describe Actions, Describe Dynamics
❌ "The server smiles then stops smiling"
✅ "The instant the performance ends reveals the gap between customer-service performance and authentic human response"

### 5. Don't Miss Subtext
❌ "Workers use their heads to clean"
✅ "Malicious compliance - literal interpretation as resistance to empty management-speak"

## SUMMARY: THE MIND THAT GETS IT

What makes analysis "get" humor at a deep level:

1. **Ask "why would a human make this choice?"** - Every edit, cut, and delivery is intentional
2. **Look for dynamics, not just actions** - Characters have motivations that create tension
3. **Recognize format as participant** - Structure can be part of the joke
4. **Find the relatable frustration** - What shared experience does this tap into?
5. **See editing as comedy tool** - Cuts, timing, and abruptness are often intentional

The difference between shallow and deep analysis is asking **"what explains this pattern?"** rather than **"what label fits this?"**
